- Before fix same code for all pages.
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-code-before.png) #### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-before.png)

4. The discription in the book search results displayed was to long so i oraginally put a slice function in to reduce the size. Crome devlpoment tools showd an error, so i changed the information displayed to the book text snippet instend of the book description in the array of results from the Google Book API.
- Book search Crome devlpoment tool error. And changed
