### API keys: 
You will need you own api keys to use the APIs correctly.
#### Google Maps key 
***
- The Google Maps key is located on the bottom of the home page index.html - The google maps api key documntation can be found at [link to documtation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

#### Creating an API key

1. Go to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page [link to the Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/google/maps-apis/credentials).
2. On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.
The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
3. Click Close.
The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.
(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)
4. Go to the bottom of the index.html page and add your new key in.
- You must include an API key with every Maps JavaScript API request. In the following example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.

      <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"></script>


#### Restricting API keys
1. Go to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page [link to the Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/google/maps-apis/credentials).
2. Select the API key that you want to set a restriction on. The API key property page appears.
3. Under Key restrictions, set the following restrictions:
    - Application restrictions:
    1. To accept requests from the list of website that you supply, select HTTP referrers (web sites) from the list of Application restrictions.
    2. Specify one or more referrer web sites. For example, *.google.com accepts all sites ending in google.com, such as https://developers.google.com.
    Note: file:// referers need a special representation to be added to the key restriction. The "file://" part should be replaced with "__file_url__" before being added to the key restriction. For example, "file:///path/to/" should be formatted as "__file_url__//path/to/*". After enabling file:// referers, it is recommended you regularly check your usage, to make sure it matches your expectations.
    -  API restrictions:
    1. Click Restrict key.
    2. Select Maps JavaScript API from Select APIs dropdown. If the Maps    JavaScript API is not listed, you need to enable it.
    3. If your project uses Places Library, also select Places API. Similarly, if your project uses other services in the JavaScript API (Directions Service, Distance Matrix Service, Elevation Service, and/or Geocoding Service), you must also enable and select the corresponding API in this list.
4. To finalize your changes, click Save.

5. Adding the API key to your request.
   - You must include an API key with every Maps JavaScript API request. In the following example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.

         <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"></script>
