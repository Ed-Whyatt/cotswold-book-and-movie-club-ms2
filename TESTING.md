## Bugs Fixed
1. Colour contrast
### The colours chosen for the Home and Search for Movie navigation button where of to low contract and have been changed.
- Before fix:
#### ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/home-color-before.png) ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/movie-before.png)
- After fix:
#### ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/home-after.png) ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/movie-after.png)
- Navigation colours after fix:
#### ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/nav-colors-after.png)
2. The locations in the upcoming events section were flowing out of the container when viewed on an extra small screen on all events. I put the locations section in its own column to prevent this.
- Before fix
#### ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/locations-code-before.png) ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/locations-before-fix.png)
- After fix 
#### ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/locations-code-after.png) ![text](/documentation/bug-fix-images/locations-after-fix.png)
3. There was a gap on the right-hand side of every page that was causing the page to show an unwanted horizontal scroll bar.
- Before fix same code for all pages.
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-code-before.png) ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-before.png)
- After fix same code for all pages.
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-code-after.png) ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/gap-after.png)
4. The description in the book search results displayed was to long so I originally put a slice function in to reduce the size. Crome development tools showed an error, so I changed the information displayed to the book text snippet instead of the book description in the array of results from the Google Book API.
- Book search Crome development tool error in console.
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/slice-bug.png)
- Code before fix in book-app.js
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/slice-old-code.png) 
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/java-slice-code-before.png)
- Code after fix in book-app.js
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/slice-new-code-two.png) 
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/slice-new-code-one.png) 
5. Crome Dev Tool showed a readability issue with the search bar in both the movie and book search pages. Iâ€™m removed the h1 heading and used the label for the heading changes are the same for both pages.
- Crome Dev Tool Readability
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/form-readabilty.png)
- Before fix
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/search-code-before.png)
- After fix
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/form-code-after.png)
6. Crome Dev Tool showed type error when reading textSnippet form the Google Book API results array. I Added some Ternary statement withing the html code to be displayed in the book-app.js, so it would have a fallback message when no results are found.
- Book search Crome development tool error in console.
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/dev-tool-book-before.png)
- Before fix
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/dev-tool-book-code-before.png)
- After fix
#### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/dev-tool-book-after.png)
7. Crome Dev Tool showed a Get http 404 error from the image in the movie-app.js when the OMDb API movie poster was called so I added some Ternary statements to the poster results for a fall-back placeholder image to show.
- Book search Crome development tool error in console.
   #### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/dev-tool-movie-before.png)
- Before fix
   #### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/dev-tool-movie-code-before.png)
- After fix
   #### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/movie-dev-code-after.png)
8. The heading and footer took up too much real estate on the page in small device view, so I changed the html with bootstrap columns and CSS using media queries.
- Small view and CSS before fix
  #### ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/header-foorter-before.png) ![text](documentation/bug-fix-images/heading-css-before.png)
